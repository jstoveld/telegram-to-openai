# Telegram Bot with OpenAI GPT-3

This is a Telegram bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate responses to user messages.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your OpenAI API key and Telegram bot token as environment variables.

## Running the Bot

Run the bot with the command `python app.py`.

## Usage

Send a message to the bot on Telegram. The bot will respond with a message generated by the GPT-3 model.

## Known Issues

It doesn't handle exceptions in a way that would prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For example, if an error occurs during the OpenAI API request, it prints the error message directly, which might contain sensitive information.
